## Description

For this assignment we were tasked (with the help of some starter code) to update routes and create a working e-commerce system to use CRUD methods to manipulate the database. With the help of SQL Workbench and Insomnia, you can test routes on a local server to add products, tags, or categories to increase or decrease the information in the database. 

Below you will find some links for the repository and the video demoing how the program works. 

Enjoy!

## Installation

Make sure you have all the necessary programs to make this program work properly. You will need [SQLWorkbench]() and [Insomnia](). Once those are downloaded, you will need to 
```
npm install
``` 
everything from the package.json file. Don't forget to 
```
npm init -y
```
to download all the dependencies. Once that is all finished, you will need to create your database on Workbench and seed that database with the seeds file!

Run
```
node seeds/index.js
```

Finally you can run 
```
node server.js
```
to turn on the localhost in your browser, open up Insomnia and start playing with some routes!
